            ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation
            and consists of pictures pieced together from the printable characters
            defined by the ASCII Standard. Most examples of ASCII art require a
            fixed-width font.

            There is also a slightly more technically advanced ASCII art mutation called
            ANSI art. ANSI art is a computer art form that was widely used at one time on
            BBSes. It is similar to ASCII art, but constructed from a larger set of 256
            letters, numbers, and symbols ‚Äî all codes found in IBM code page 437, often
            referred to as extended ASCII and used in MS-DOS and Unix environments. ANSI
            art also contains special ANSI escape sequences that color text with the 16
            foreground and 8 background colours offered by ANSI.SYS, an MS-DOS device
            driver loosely based upon the ANSI X3.64 standard for text terminals. Some
            ANSI artists take advantage of the cursor control sequences within ANSI X3.64
            in order to create animations, commonly referred to as ANSImations - however,
            there are also examples of ASCII art using animation.

            ASCII art technique is widely used by artists, hobbysts, hackers. Especially
            interesting example of use and creative development of the ASCII art are
            works created by the "ASCII Art Ensemble" group. The group, formed by Walter
            van der Cruijsen, Luka Frelih, Vuk Cosic, was founded in 1998. Members of
            the "ASCII Art Ensemble" created a software to "code" moving images into
            animated (sequential) ASCII art pieces. Most recognizable work by the group
            is "Deep ASCII" - an ASCII version of the famous pornographic film "Deep
            Throat" from 1972.

            ASCII art is also a descendant of the concrete and vsual poetry and so called
            "typewriter art": a pre-computer technique of creating images from characters
            available in typewriters (the first known piece of typewriter art ‚Äî an image
            of a butterfly composed of brackets, dashes, slashes, and an asterisk, made
            by Flora Stacey, a British secretary, in 1898 <a href="https://bit.ly/2t5IC1N">[https://bit.ly/2t5IC1N]</a>).
